Hello everyone!

Many of you might be thinking, 
1. What is this project about?
2. Why should I care?
This project is built upon the theme of loremipsum and is basically based on the following idea:- A tool which is inspired by what lorem ipsum was built to create. Lorem ipsum was built to help designers focus on the design, and not on the content.....to focus on delivering the best UI/UX experience possible without designers troubling themselves with adding content....to focus on the bigger picture. Similarly, our tool, allows designers to upload wireframes of their project and our tool converts it to code. It also converts code to make it compatible across platforms and frameworks, spending time on what's important. Design. not functionality
This project was built for the hackathon of CodeDay@IIT Delhi in 1 day. It won #2 prize in advanced category[there were only 2 categories:- beginner and advanced]
It won in a competition where students from Grade 8th to College 1st year compete.
and i am just in 8th grade....
but is this post bragging my acheivement?
No. I wrote this to inspire you, to build something cool and go against the system.

Bye. and btw, do not compare yourself to anyone except your past.

bye and have a good day :)
